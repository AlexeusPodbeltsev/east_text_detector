### Before we begin
Before start using a project, you should have pre-installed poetry.
If you don't have it, you can use next command:

After completing an installation step, you must follow next steps:
* Change the directory to the project dir
```bash
cd east_text_detector
```
* Use `poetry install` to read the pyproject.toml file, resolves the dependencies, and installs them.
```bash
poetry install
```
* Use `poetry shell` to activate virtual environment
```bash
poetry shell
```
* After that change the directory to source files
```bash
cd east_text_detector
```
* Run the program
```bash
python3 demo.py
```
* Finally, to deactivate virtual environment simply use `exit` command
```bash
